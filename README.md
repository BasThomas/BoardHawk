# BoardHawk

BoardHawk is an example application that shows off the start of an app that supports Catalyst, and is thus running on both iOS and macOS.

I wanted to do a serious attempt at building an app running on both platforms. While this application is only a start, I think it does show the possibilities of Catalyst.
